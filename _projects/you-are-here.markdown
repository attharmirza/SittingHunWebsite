**You Are Here** is a web series from *The Atlantic* that explores the science of everyday life. Science writers come on as hosts, and animated segments help illustrate their ideas.

I had the privilege of working on a few episodes of this series, working with the writers to animate everything from futuristic cities to cars with chicken on them, congressional districts, and Norwegian soap factory workers.

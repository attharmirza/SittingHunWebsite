    text: I also added some other boats contributing to the effort, based on data
      from VesselFinder, satellite imagery from Maxar, and excellent reporting
      from my colleagues. The models are to scale but are more low-poly and
      diagrammatic.

I worked on an in-depth reconstruction of the effort that dislodged the Ever Given container ship from the Suez Canal. For this project, my biggest contribution was a 3D model of the Ever Given and a section of the Suez Canal based on photos and cross sections. I made it in Blender, and tried to get it as accurate as I could with the available information. Check out the full story [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/suez-canal-ever-given-freed-visual-analysis/).

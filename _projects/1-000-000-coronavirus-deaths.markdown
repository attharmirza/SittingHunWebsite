description: I created a data visualization for a story marking when the global
  coronavirus death toll passed 1,000,000 deaths, a statistic very difficult to
  imagine. The visualization broke that number down using a streamgraph coded in
  D3. It shows how many people have died every day since the pandemic began.

I created a data visualization for a story marking when the global coronavirus death toll passed 1,000,000 deaths, a statistic very difficult to imagine. The visualization broke that number down using a streamgraph coded in D3. It shows how many people have died every day since the pandemic began. 

In a way, this is the story of the entire pandemic to date. You can see the early coronavirus-related deaths in China, the surge in Europe and subsequently the U.S., the rising death toll in India â€” and one day, hopefully, a return to the sharp point at which we started.

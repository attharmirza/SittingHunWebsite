description: These renders of a Red Fox were done as an exercise in character rigging.
  The low poly mesh was made, rigged, weight painted and animated in Blender. I did
  my best to replicate the grace of a red fox, but I can't claim to have captured
  the majesty of the real animal.

These renders of a *Red Fox* were done as an exercise in character rigging. The low poly mesh was made, rigged, weight painted and animated in Blender. I did my best to replicate the grace of a red fox, but I can't claim to have captured the majesty of the real animal.

The four photo collage was selected for an OpenGrounds art gallery showing at UVA.

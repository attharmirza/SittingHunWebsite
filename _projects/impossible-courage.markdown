description: Impossible Courage is an experience that uses virtual reality to place
  people in the shoes of lives we otherwise couldn’t imagine. It is based on the asylum
  seekers leaving from Northern Africa to enter Europe through Italy. The goal is
  to help people in the Western world empathize with the large number of people seeking
  safety at their borders, across the cultural divide. The project seeks to shift
  the conversation, making it come from a point of understanding rather than a point
  of fear.

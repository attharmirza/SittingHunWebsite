[**Forbidden Greens**](https://forbidden-greens.netlify.com/) is a landing page designed for a local musicians new single, by the same name. It's a visualization and music player, with a download link for the song. The website was successful in its purpose: entertain visitors visually to keep them listening to the song through the end.

This was an opportunity for me to learn html5's audio features and play with a newer web visualization language called p5.js.

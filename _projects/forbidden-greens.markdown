[**Forbidden Greens**](https://forbidden-greens.netlify.com/) is a landing page designed for a local musician's new single, by the same name. It's a visualization and music player, with a download link for the song. While you listen to the song, you can draw "vines" across the window. The website was successful in its purpose: entertain visitors visually to keep them listening to the song through the end.

This was an opportunity for me to learn html5's audio features and play with the JavaScript adaptation of Processing, p5. Explore the [**website**](https://forbidden-greens.netlify.com/) to hear the song and see the animation.

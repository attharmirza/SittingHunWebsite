[**Fentanyl Kingpin**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b-MeK5-NaQ) is a documentary about how a doting father became the head of a large fentanyl dealing operation in Texas's panhandle. I got to animate key events in the story and develop a graphic style for the whole film. The project was an opportunity that came early in my time at The Washington Post, and I learned so much in the process. Probably the biggest skill I got out of this project was proficiency with animation and rendering in Cinema4D.

The film has garnered over 850,000 views on YouTube and gave me a byline with Pulitzer winning filmmaker Dalton Bennett. Watch the full project [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1b-MeK5-NaQ).

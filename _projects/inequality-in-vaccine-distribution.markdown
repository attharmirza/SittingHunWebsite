I took a look at the widening gap in vaccination rates between high and low income countries, and built an interactive data visualization and a series of dynamic charts for the final published story. You can see it [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/coronavirus-vaccine-inequality-global/), and a version of the chart also shows up in the Washington Post's worldwide pandemic tracker [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?itid=hp_pandemic%20test).

In addition to getting more familiar with advanced D3 techniques (such as voronoi interaction and force simulation), I also learned how to integrate it with React. Part of my process for coding the chart can be seen at my Observable notebook, [**here**](https://observablehq.com/@attharmirza/wealthier-countries-have-higher-vaccination-rates?collection=@attharmirza/masters). The project was featured on the homepage and seen by thousands.

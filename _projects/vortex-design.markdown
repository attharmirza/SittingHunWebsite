description: Vortex 2016 was a 3-day competition sponsored by the University of Virginia
  Architecture School. I was on the communications team for the event, in charge of
  creating branding and promotional content around the competition. Within the team,
  I created the logo, its animated version, and a few timelapses showing the teams
  working. The animated logo was viewed hundreds of times and shared across the architecture
  school.

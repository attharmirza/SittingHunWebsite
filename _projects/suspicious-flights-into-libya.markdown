This [**story**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/libya-civil-war-russia-turkey-fighter-planes/) was part of a series revisiting the impact of the Arab Spring a decade later. I worked with investigative reporters to trace suspicious Turkish and Russian flights delivering troops and weapons into Libya. It was an incredible opportunity to work on a big Washington Post investigative story, and to design for an interactive scrolling layout. I even got to contribute some reporting when locating origin and destination airstrips for the flights, and getting tracking data for a cargo plane coming from Russia. You can see the full story [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/libya-civil-war-russia-turkey-fighter-planes/).

The flight paths were visualized using D3 in an Observable notebook, and then brought into Adobe Illustrator for final styling. I then took those vector files into Adobe After Effects for the main map animation.

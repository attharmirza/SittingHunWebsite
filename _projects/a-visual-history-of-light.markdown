description: A Visual History of Light was my contribution to a long running series
  by The Atlantic. It examines the major evolutions in humanity's efforts to manipulate
  light, from the first man-made fire to the modern use of 192 lasers to trigger hydrogen
  fusion. This video earned a Vimeo Staff Pick.

  asset: This animation went particularly smoothly because the hand drawn storyboard,
    as seen above, is not far from the final look and feel of the short film.

[**A Visual History of Light**](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/560585/visual-history-light/) was my contribution to a long running series by The Atlantic. It examines the major evolutions in humanity's efforts to manipulate light, from the first man-made fire to the modern use of 192 lasers to trigger hydrogen fusion.

The project was an opportunity for growth and a large undertaking for me: it required a lot of 3D modeling and animation in a short amount of time, condensing 2 months of research into a 2 minute video, and realizing the deceptively simple, striking visual style. 

The video earned a [**Vimeo Staff Pick**](https://vimeo.com/270454241), my first!

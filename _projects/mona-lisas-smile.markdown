[**Mona Lisa's Smile**](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/542025/leonardo-da-vinci-augmented-reality-mona-lisa/) was an animation produced as an accompaniment to a cover story for *The Atlantic*. The animation explores the science behind Leonardo Da Vinci's legendary painting.

I was lucky enough to pitch, write, animate, sound design and narrate the video. It received 330 thousand views across social media, and was shared by the head of video at Apple News.

    text: "The most complicated animation I contributed was the one above, which
      simultaneously mapped three vantage points during a key moment in the
      timeline: the first charge by police into protesters. Overall, I mapped
      the starting point of over 40 different clips to help give us a full
      picture of the day's events as we reported the story."

My colleagues and I built a comprehensive picture of the law enforcement crackdown on protesters before Trump's June 1 photo op. You can see the full story [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/06/08/timeline-trump-church-photo-op/?arc404=true). My contribution to the project included geo-locating footage, mapping police lines, helping identify the different police forces present, and animating large segments of the video (as well as coding Motion Graphics Templates in Adobe After Effects to make the animation process more efficient).

The video has garnered over 1.5 million views on YouTube alone, and won numerous awards including the duPont-Columbia baton.

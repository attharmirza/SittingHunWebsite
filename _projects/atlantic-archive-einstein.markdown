The [**Atlantic Archive: Albert Einstein**](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/557987/einstein-atomic-war/) film was the fourth in a series by _The Atlantic_. Each animator took an article from the publisher's extensive 160 year old archive, articles that resonate today, and adapted it to an animation. I chose the article "Atomic War or Peace" by Albert Einstein. The project was an amazing experience for me because not only did I play my usual roles of pitching, scripting, animating and doing sound design, I also produced this video. Part of the new challenges with this role involved casting a narrator that worked remotely from, incidentally, across the Atlantic ocean.

The film was picked up by Digg on the day of release, and accrued approximately 13,000 views on YouTube and Vimeo.

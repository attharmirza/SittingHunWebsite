description: 8x10's and Murals is the official music video for Nonchabont's song of
  the same name. The majority of this music video contains a combination of 3D animation
  and frame-by-frame animation at 24 frames per second. It took a lot of labor and
  patience to complete, but the effect is mesmerizing. The video won Best Music Video
  at the Virginia Student Film Festival.

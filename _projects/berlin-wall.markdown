**Breaking Down the Berlin Wall** is a short film that commemorates the 25th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall by re-examining it's history as a series of creative escapes to West Berlin. The lengths to which people went to cross the wall show that it was doomed to fail. No unjust barrier, ceiling or cage can hold back the pressure of a free spirit's will.

This project was selected for a finalist prize in the the University of Virginia's "Fall of the Wall" school-wide art contest.

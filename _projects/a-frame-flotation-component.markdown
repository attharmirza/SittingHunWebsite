This [**Flotation Component**](https://aframe-ocean-flotation.glitch.me/) for A-frame was built as a tool for a larger project I was developing. The component was used in conjunction with the ocean plugin that comes with A-frame's extended toolkit, and allowed a simple flotation animation to be generated based on the waves around an object. This block of code was an especially important milestone for me, because it was the first time I wrote code that was intended to be used by other coders and web developers. This meant I had to learn how to write configurable, re-usable code and learn to program within a component based structure.

All this was especially cool because the creator of A-frame (including the ocean component and many other plugins) and a developer at Google, [**Don McCurdy**](https://github.com/donmccurdy), responded when I sent him what I had made. Of course, I need to make a few improvements, but the fact that he could understand it and actually liked was still major validation.

  A Reckoning for Eric Garner's Death is an interactive graphic story to
  accompany Wesley Lowery's coverage of the trial that finally adjudicated
  Garner's case. I both created a series of looping animations and wrote the
  text that boiled Lowery's coverage down to its essence

      The loop above was pretty tricky to do, it gave me a lot of respect for
      those infinitely looping 3D animations all over Instagram.

****[**A Reckoning for Eric Garner's Death**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/amp-stories/eric-garner-trial/) is an interactive graphic story to accompany Wesley Lowery's coverage of the trial that finally adjudicated Garner's case. I both created a series of looping animations and wrote the text that boiled Lowery's coverage down to its essence. It was such an honor to work with the Pulitzer-winning journalist, and I learned a lot about effective storytelling. See the full graphic [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/amp-stories/eric-garner-trial/).

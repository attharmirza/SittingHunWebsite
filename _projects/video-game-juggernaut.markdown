  corner of the medium. The resulting journey is full of wildly varied set
  pieces and unexpected cultural touchstones.

The Washington Post published my animated film as some of the first content under a new vertical focused on covering video games. As part of covering an expansive industry, the film pays homage to art from almost every corner of the medium. The resulting journey is full of wildly varied set pieces and unexpected cultural touchstones.

For the project, I reported the story, wrote the script, created and animated tons of 3D models, painted some frame-by-frame 2D animation, did the voiceover, and put together the sound design.

The project was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, and won a White House News Photographer's Association award.

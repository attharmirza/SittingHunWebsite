description: The Washington Post published my animated film as some of the first
  content under a new vertical focused on covering video games. As part of
  covering an expansive industry, the film pays homage to art from almost every
  corner of the medium. The resulting journey is full of wildly varied set
  pieces and unexpected cultural touchstones.

    text: The style for the animation came from a desire to bridge the iconic 8-bit
      look with what modern game engines enable. The answer? Some sweet
      volumetric pixels using Blender's "remesh" modifier. I could use a polygon
      modeling workflow and still get voxels as a result. This style and
      approach also left me room to mix in subtle details like subsurface
      scattering and more dramatic stuff like smoke simulations.

    text: To avoid re-rendering when revising charts or maps, I composited 2D
      graphics in Adobe After Effects rather than using textured meshes. This
      meant using a material identifier render pass and getting some null
      object/camera data from Blender.

The Washington Post published my animated film as some of the first content under a new vertical focused on covering video games. As part of covering an expansive industry, the film pays homage to art from almost every corner of the medium. The resulting journey is full of wildly varied set pieces and unexpected cultural touchstones.

For the project, I reported the story, wrote the script, created and animated tons of 3D models, painted some frame-by-frame 2D animation, did the voiceover, and put together the sound design.

The project was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, and won a White House News Photographer's Association award.

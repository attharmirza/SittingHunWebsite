description: These Procedural Material Studies were created using the cycles render
  engine in Blender 2.76. The goal was to approach hyper realism using only node-based
  procedural texturing. None of the renders use tiled image textures, everything was
  constructed with various compositing techniques and fractal patterns (noise, voronoi
  textures, etc.).

  asset: These scenes were built from procedural material tests, shown below. The
    tests were created using the cycles render engine in Blender 2.76. The goal was
    to approach hyper realism using only node-based procedural texturing. The renders
    use only 3 tiled image textures, everything else was constructed with various
    compositing techniques and fractal patterns (noise, voronoi textures, etc.).

description: These Procedural Material Studies were created using the cycles render
  engine in Blender 2.76. The goal was to approach hyper realism using only node-based
  procedural texturing. None of the renders use tiled image textures, everything was
  constructed with various compositing techniques and fractal patterns (noise, voronoi
  textures, etc.).

These **Procedural Material Studies** were created using the cycles render engine in Blender 2.76. The goal was to approach hyper realism using only node-based procedural texturing. None of the renders use tiled image textures, everything was constructed with various compositing techniques and fractal patterns (noise, voronoi textures, etc.).

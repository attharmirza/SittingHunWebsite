description: Just You Wait is a proposed renovation for waiting room spaces, specifically
  designed for cancer patients and infusion centers. It is highly adaptable, however,
  for any waiting situation where privacy is a benefit. The project is a dynamic roofing
  system, which expands into private pods with a projection mapped information access
  point.

**Just You Wait** is a proposed renovation for waiting room spaces, specifically designed for cancer patients and infusion centers. It is highly adaptable, however, for any waiting situation where privacy is a benefit. The project is a dynamic roofing system, which expands into private pods with a projection mapped information access point.

The project was selected and photographed for publication in the University of Virginia School of Architectureâ€™s website.

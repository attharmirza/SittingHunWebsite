description: Atthar Mirza is a web developer, animator, and designer. He loves interactive
  graphics and 3D modeling because they allow him to extract the images in his brain
  and bring them to life. Most recently, Atthar Mirza works at the Atlantic as a professional
  animator and web developer, pitching and creating original work. He has been doing
  professional freelance work under the brand The Sitting Hun since 2012, and is thankful
  the Mayans were wrong because he was just getting started.

  Atthar Mirza is a web developer, animator, and designer. He loves interactive graphics, digital modeling, and making pixels move because they extract the images in his brain and bring them to life. He currently works at The Washington Post, and has been creating work under the brand The Sitting Hun since 2012. Thankfully, the Mayans were wrong â€“ he was just getting started.

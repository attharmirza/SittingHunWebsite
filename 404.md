Oh my gosh, you've wandered off to somewhere you shouldn't be! I wasn't prepared for this... it's kind of embarassing. Maybe click somewhere else and we can pretend we never saw this? 

If you're still reading this, I don't understand your line of reasoning.

Okay, you're still here. Please, **[click this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)**. Goodbye!

Now this is getting a little awkward.

One of us has to stop, otherwise we'll be here all day.

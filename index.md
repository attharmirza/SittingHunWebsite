  Atthar Mirza is a web developer, animator, and designer. He loves interactive
  graphics, digital modeling, and making pixels move because they extract the
  images in his brain and bring them to life. He currently works at The
  Washington Post, and has been doing professional freelance work under the
  brand The Sitting Hun since 2012. Thankfully, the Mayans were wrong â€“ he was
  just getting started.

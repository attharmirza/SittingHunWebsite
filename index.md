description: Atthar Mirza is a web developer, animator, and designer. He loves interactive graphics and 3D modeling because they allow him to extract the images in his brain and bring them to life. Atthar has been doing professional freelance work under the brand The Sitting Hun since 2012, and is thankful the Mayans were wrong because he was just getting started.
